1
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:17,014
thank you lineup

2
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:21,383
easy Massa %uh let's get down to something
more difficult yeah

3
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:24,593
%uh my name's Jim blame him %um like she
said

4
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:30,354
%uh my day job is had a biomedical
research facility for doing that genomic

5
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:31,820
analysis on

6
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:34,601
worms and flies in other sciences stuff
but

7
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:38,620
%uh for fun over I like to look at

8
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:42,062
%uh data visualizations and an interactive
once and today I'd like to

9
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:46,119
%uh talk about that the force layout
Coloma more detail

10
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:50,053
and and how to %uh I use it and

11
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:54,102
in a non traditional manner some so
we're gonna be abusing the force they

12
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:54,657
are typically

13
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,010
here's %ah here's a you know we just saw %ah

14
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:03,012
example have your traditional course
layout andy is this is

15
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:06,019
typically utilize for your social
network or your

16
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:09,094
congress' voting on the same stuff you
know network based stuff

17
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:13,163
%um but we're going to abuse this force a
little bit

18
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,410
and come up with some novel ways to
apply it

19
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:21,103
%ah to other data visualization techniques
to make your %ah life a little bit easier

20
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:27,102
so for size 12 get everybody on a
baseline of what

21
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:31,711
what exactly what we're talking about I
mean force layout %um

22
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:35,780
I think you know for most people work I
would agree that I with the right amount

23
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:36,093
of notes

24
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:39,172
in Europe with the right amount above
was in your layout

25
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,700
%um it's a pleasing way it's a pretty
way to draw a graph

26
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:47,030
%um it but it works underneath the
covers is working as a physical

27
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:49,121
simulation so you to these notes

28
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:54,430
is kinda but a charged force are charged
particle excuse me

29
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,310
and they have these charges work to

30
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:01,060
to move to reports or to attract them in
different ways

31
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:05,021
and the links between these notes
constrain that movement and the

32
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:06,874
simulation works as a giant

33
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,120
loop so %uh each iteration each cycle
this loop %ah

34
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,351
the charges are %ah are im

35
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:20,850
impact the notes they move and visual
display is updated and that looping just

36
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,118
occurs over and over again

37
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:25,041
until it settles into a stable
configuration

38
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,042
%um so that's that's the force layout

39
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:32,133
in a not so that's that's how it usually
works I'm a big fan of

40
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:37,332
this concept that everything is a remix
%uh which I first kinda last onto from

41
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:38,680
curry ferguson's

42
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:41,657
a wonderful videos which you haven't
seen %ah

43
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,720
put in your headphones now I'm and so it
wasn't on ignore me

44
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:48,075
%ah but his his main thesis is that

45
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:51,156
%um in the art in the creative world %ah

46
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:55,205
new works are created by simple

47
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,120
modifications of existing work see you
take you take some existing stuff you

48
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:04,044
copy you transform into you combine %ah at
a great new pieces

49
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:07,078
and it his his videos are about

50
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:11,147
that occurring in the arts in music and
and %um

51
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,000
literature and the movies by the good

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,061
is also true and I think we've seen this
in a number of presentations

53
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:21,160
%ah also true and the data visualization
world so

54
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:25,790
for this stock would like to provide
some remix will components

55
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,136
%uh little nuggets love love useful

56
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:32,195
you know trickery that that we could
start thinking about

57
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,524
applying to I your own visualizations

58
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,720
so that means we're a look at some code
and of West not a terrible mistake

59
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:44,061
%um so let's start with the force level
they start out with just

60
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,060
looking at just a note so its build-up
this first probability up a simple no

61
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:50,295
layout indeed three

62
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,385
id3 is a powerful tool for this because
%ah

63
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,723
I think we'll see the %ah succinct miss
that you can write

64
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,902
and start using that the force laid out
Emilie and

65
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,640
look the chances are you're five using
the three in your other stuff so it's a

66
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:04,443
good

67
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,094
%uh that it has that and in the talk at
that you could use

68
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,788
%um so like everything in d3 %ah the notes

69
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,004
are going to be represented by some data
so here we have

70
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:20,070
are just are are basic data says an
array have

71
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:23,022
objects and he's object has some
attributes here we just have

72
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:27,025
the and the amount that review together
force layout started

73
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:30,049
it's pretty easy to create a new
instance a force layout

74
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:33,648
you pass and your data your notes %um

75
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:38,800
as the notes parameter and then you
start and then

76
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:42,077
%um what talk about this year the second
you but you also want to just listen to

77
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:43,126
the takeover

78
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:47,435
and that as we'll see allows you access
to

79
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,520
the simulation each iteration each loop
up that simulation

80
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:55,121
%um an important thing to remember about

81
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:59,036
d3 and in general and and the

82
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:02,155
force led and in particular %uh is that

83
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,572
you not constrained by particular Rep
visual representation right that's one

84
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:07,520
of the big powers on the

85
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:09,149
up the whole idea but that doesn't mean
you have to do a little bit of extra

86
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:11,708
work to get things going

87
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:15,193
so a couple more pieces I've love of
code

88
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:19,664
%uh first you have to you have to decide
what how you want to visualize your

89
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,347
a force layout so you have to visualize
your

90
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,450
simulation so in these will just use
some SVG circles

91
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:31,014
%uh but really your keep in mind that
could be anything that will see a couple

92
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:32,487
examples of other stuff

93
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,168
and right now %uh so yet so you your
binder data

94
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:41,580
%uh in this case the force nodes to to
that visual representation

95
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:44,112
and right now we won't use any
attributes so that that it would issue

96
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,100
some static const int for

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,036
the radius now inside

98
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:53,595
when the for sale starts you get %um

99
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,020
your data attributes good injected with
some

100
00:05:57,002 --> 00:06:01,006
variables are some more attributes I if
they weren't very present

101
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:04,089
and specifically will look at the X&Y
axes view

102
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:08,102
that body it added to each element have
your data rate

103
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,451
and these represent the current position
have that

104
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:15,514
a the no did being represented by that
%um

105
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,930
visual at every iteration love the

106
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,080
layout so you can use that to position

107
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,887
your %um your notes and so this is the
text function

108
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,041
this is a the simplest example the tech
function this'll get called executed

109
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:31,450
every

110
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:34,111
iteration of the simulation and we can
use the

111
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:38,095
X&Y from being provided by arse are
forced layout

112
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:41,103
%um update to move modify the positions of
the

113
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:45,087
circles the that were using to represent

114
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:49,186
so with all that you get a you cover get
a couple circles frames

115
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:53,740
%ah would you can you already see that
this is a nice

116
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:57,086
%ah visual attractive %ah same

117
00:06:57,086 --> 00:07:00,137
and it only took a few lines of code to
do this so

118
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:04,626
what what's going on behind the scenes
to help make this attractive are

119
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,130
are the forces that we've mentioned that
are working on it to these notes

120
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:12,802
I like to talk about briefly a charged
and gravity

121
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,950
charge %uh I get my guy up charge
represents

122
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,246
%um the the reporter attraction between

123
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,860
each node in every other node so %um

124
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:27,135
a more negative values cause the nose to
repulse from one another

125
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:32,380
and more and less negative and positive
eyes causing to attract

126
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,387
%um so you are gonna make cool stuff like
that

127
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:41,070
um gravity on like this forever is not
down to her thats

128
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:44,146
is moreover events described as a
physical spring

129
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,740
spring-like same attached to the center
%uh the

130
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:50,131
visualizations so a higher gravity I'm

131
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:55,430
constrains it to the center and if you
let go of gravity you

132
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,716
everything flows out the space so I'll

133
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:03,830
just this this beginner introduction
knowledge to

134
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,982
the layout you can start to abuse the
force and our own

135
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,773
in our own way um and the first abuse
can be

136
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,830
%uh the example that irene was talking
about the

137
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:20,107
the public char and this was first are
one the first so you know best ways

138
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:25,086
this was shown was a New York Times
visualization that

139
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:28,193
was looking at the Obama a budget
proposal

140
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:33,250
and some use in the you know term budget
a bubble charge us to read mean

141
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:38,244
were using the the node size to
represent some underlying data about you

142
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,570
so how would how we might we

143
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:44,061
be able to implement this type a
visualization

144
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:47,194
using the knowledge that we have about
of course layout

145
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,191
well the first date is easy weekend and
city views in some static const int

146
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:55,172
for rads we can scale the size were
published by

147
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:59,130
the data that is representing you know
that we wanted to represent on

148
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:04,031
and that gets us halfway there I but
unfortunately everything's overlapping

149
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:05,106
nothing looks good anymore

150
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:09,043
so what we do the the inside is that we
can

151
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:13,087
passe function to our charge primary
doesn't have to be constrained by ice

152
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,132
data casa neither

153
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:19,048
and so you can use so this this now
functional get

154
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:22,077
executed for each node in your layout

155
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:26,160
I at the start up the force a a at that
start

156
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:31,052
time and so we can use the date itself

157
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:36,063
to scale um are are charged are reported
value

158
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:40,101
by this the amount that is being
virtuous and with those two changes

159
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:44,048
we did this nice a

160
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:47,055
affects right each node is is pushing
away a relative

161
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:52,047
to a its size and the sizes are then
scaled by the day

162
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:56,102
you're looking for so it was very nice

163
00:09:57,002 --> 00:10:00,016
um and this is my this is

164
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:04,093
the the summation of the whole talk

165
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:07,118
so study it %uh

166
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:12,059
I think Mike Bostock a said it very
eloquently when he said the force lay

167
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,115
out there is an implicit way

168
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:17,076
to do position encoding I'm gonna remix
that

169
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:21,077
quote slightly and say it's a lazy way
to move notes around

170
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:24,137
but its it's a good kind of lazy so on

171
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:28,045
as we'll see in these these other
examples where we

172
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:33,023
don't have to care about %uh each
individual location of that

173
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:36,106
up the no 2 instead impose simple rules

174
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:41,013
in our simulation right and allow the
notes to find

175
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:44,059
correct positions based on our simple
rule set that were given a

176
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:48,070
yeah here we're just using that the
charge the simple rule that charges

177
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,061
relative to size

178
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,055
and that's all it takes so

179
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,126
how ask away abuse this concept to apply
I'm several forces

180
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:01,100
a yeah ask your nice yeah

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,046
I like the Darth Vader is the evil lists
character and yet in the book your the

182
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:06,145
movie

183
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:10,066
a well the the original one here

184
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:15,115
up had this cool feature where but you
could split apart notes based on some

185
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:21,080
categorical values so here the it's
mandatory versus discretionary spending

186
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:24,057
which brings us to the idea I love up

187
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,065
imposing our our own are applying it
yeah

188
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:31,132
a imposing our own custom forces onto
the

189
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:35,040
the notes so I recreated on

190
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,031
part serve the the New York Times one

191
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,033
a visualization in this up demo for the
for the

192
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:46,078
blog post about this is gates

193
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,096
spending so the Gates Foundation on so
that time was cut off but

194
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:54,162
and their then the grant sizes that
they've provided over the years

195
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:58,139
so and in this the CAG or the character
Oracle

196
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,048
slaying we can do is over years and so
you can see

197
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,035
you get this really nice organic a
feeling

198
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,115
and they came back emerge back together
so it's pretty

199
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:14,040
a and it's useful so how do we do that

200
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:17,045
well here's our our basic take function

201
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,163
the whole the whole general idea of
customs forces

202
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:25,069
in this in this example is we can modify
this slightly

203
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:29,084
to add enough first day you know a
function at jacks with your notes

204
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:29,175
somehow

205
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:34,087
and modifies the in position slightly

206
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:39,098
and then use that %uh to then that
modify position to them

207
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:43,134
position are nuts um so here's an
example

208
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:47,133
I and we all go through all the code but
a

209
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,088
in this we would have some some way to
represent

210
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:54,144
the two centers that we want to have a
rest let up I know it's

211
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:59,045
from left to right and out we

212
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:02,107
grab where you have a function called
move toward center

213
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:07,055
you know Tagore centre a and this this
is a function that returns a function

214
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:08,056
will see why

215
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:12,194
in a minute on but so we grabbed are the
correct

216
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,300
the crank sensor for our particular
nodes by member this is going to get

217
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,055
executed each

218
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:20,085
if reach node I'm and then

219
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:24,035
move move that node based on the centers

220
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:27,098
location so that almost works

221
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,131
here's our are nodes when we when we buy
that

222
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,047
custom force up we're back to everything

223
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:38,062
its slamming on top of one another so
what's going on with you

224
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:41,141
we've lost that a nice thing that I just
that was the whole point in this talk

225
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,079
was that we did not care about stuff now
it seems like we don't care about

226
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,092
everyone work position on Alyssa um

227
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:53,093
fortunately we have this this access to
this

228
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,116
predator which is which is indicated as
alpha

229
00:13:57,016 --> 00:14:01,038
arm now we can think of it as a blending
parameter I that can be used to combine

230
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:04,085
multiple forces are charges on these
notes

231
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:08,086
and if we it's accessible from the on
force

232
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:12,124
instance but you can also get to it from
from the tech function at each iteration

233
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:14,106
inside of an event

234
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:18,033
that's faster and if we were to print
those out

235
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:21,034
we can see that it starts around .1

236
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:24,092
and gives decker minute slightly every
iteration

237
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:27,158
above the every loophole that that
simulation and then what it means

238
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:32,757
um yet what when it gets too up-close
2.05 it'll end

239
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,710
so the numbers are arbitrary but the
idea is that this is

240
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:40,104
the actual a mechanism by by which the
force layout is

241
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:44,303
is settling down and two I mean it's
it's the

242
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,790
can be considered a form of simulated
annealing if if you're into that kinda

243
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:47,086
thing

244
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,068
around but but this is what's causing
the

245
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:54,135
the stabilization of the force layout
and general

246
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:59,082
so we can use this parameter and here's
the same code but

247
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:02,166
instead of a so here now we get to pass
and a

248
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:06,080
the Alpha into our into our move toward

249
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:10,055
category centers and with that small
tweaks this is why this is why it's a

250
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:14,076
function return to function is because
so it allows us to pass and

251
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:17,143
variables I without creating a global
variable we can pass and locally and

252
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:18,102
here

253
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,071
and had have access to on in our in our
closer to here

254
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,105
um but with that small tweak veins

255
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,016
now work as you expect now wouldn't work
and not

256
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:32,016
a here when we separate them out

257
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:35,089
love the it the alpha blending allows
our

258
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:38,160
charges that are now relative to the the
size of the notes

259
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,034
to be blended with our custom force and

260
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:45,146
a works with a lot of nose and works if
you

261
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:50,082
dragging around though the stick to
their centers but again we're not

262
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,089
were not worried really about where

263
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,168
you to these notes goes we just on time
you guys club here you guys come up here

264
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:02,093
and they figure things out Scott nice
Tom

265
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:05,185
so let's look at another iteration of
this

266
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:10,151
i right now the to the reports in the
charge

267
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:14,074
that's that's a associate with each
other's noses nice

268
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,233
it keeps them the nodes away from one
another but it

269
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,540
it's kind of an eventual process right
so what if you wanted

270
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:24,150
that to be a more constrained more
formal

271
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:28,032
looking a distinction on

272
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:31,151
where you we're gonna ever mandeville
simple collision detection

273
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:35,052
in the same manner so this was dunno I
like

274
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:38,060
remix in New York Times graphics a

275
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:41,068
and by remix you know where but I

276
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,026
a by this is done by another great piece

277
00:16:45,026 --> 00:16:49,079
where that were visualizing a the words
different words said

278
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,176
at the different national conventions
during the elections

279
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:56,123
and I R I implemented again support to
this

280
00:16:57,023 --> 00:17:01,061
and another visualization that just
looks at a word frequencies and

281
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,380
and some books but the the point if it
is that now

282
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,270
from when we move these guys around at
the there's

283
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,926
nice hard-line around each in their
their clout in there and they're

284
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:17,243
um maintaining that a parameter around
them

285
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:21,260
today implement this a is the same

286
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:24,080
same idea ennui we use another

287
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:27,106
I'll modification function we can call
it collide

288
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,123
and I just look at well as look at
pseudocode here on

289
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:35,025
because the it's not difficult was a
long

290
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:38,030
so again this has been executed for each

291
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:41,037
node on at every cycle

292
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:44,140
%uh that's the that physical simulation
the nose layout

293
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:49,089
so we just inside this we can loop
through all the other notes

294
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:55,050
and then do a simple distance check if
if they're too close based on

295
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:58,077
the the values %uh the data attributes
that we already know

296
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:03,051
in in those in those nodes that we just
move them back by half

297
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:06,052
I'll I so we get that I was that

298
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:10,089
slight modification we can get this nice
look it works with other custom

299
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,258
a forces like them always like that and
it works with

300
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,070
any number of nodes that you put into it

301
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:22,616
and this this is a a brute-force
mechanism the that you can optimize but

302
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,080
just a starting point for this kind of a
visualization

303
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:31,008
you can do core stuff like the the demo
of putting an invisible node

304
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:34,100
underneath your me your mouse cursor and
then every time all your other

305
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,082
little notes are afraid of it just fun
to

306
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:43,094
okay oh yeah I want more and

307
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:46,116
there's nothing that mandates that you
have to move them

308
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:50,045
back by half so if you start increasing
that

309
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:54,058
that movement you can end up with this
nice but useless popcorn

310
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:57,061
explosion star colliding with one
another and

311
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:00,149
getting scared him right away just one

312
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:05,065
I'll okay so let's say I think this is
Dragon Ball Z not really

313
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:08,224
a Star Wars buzzer as a force

314
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:12,080
a let's add some some links you know

315
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:17,032
finally um with links constrain the
locations

316
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,037
that our notes can move around a

317
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:24,062
II here's Jersey example with the links
now

318
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,123
and as you might expect the three links
are also represented

319
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:32,352
and data so the minimum two things you
need in your link data

320
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,130
our source and a target which represent
the two

321
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:39,022
I know is that they're connecting with
you can do this either via an index into

322
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,007
the nodes are a

323
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:45,060
or with the actual notes themselves and
if you do in an index

324
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:48,063
when they're forced layoff starts
they'll be translated into

325
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:52,036
the notes themselves which means you
have access to

326
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:55,051
up both the source and target no data

327
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:58,086
on you need a visualize on some way view

328
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:02,095
if you so choose and so we can draw
simple line in this example

329
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:06,111
and then like I said you have access to
the source and destination

330
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:11,089
our source and target a data and you can
use their X&Y coordinates

331
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:14,151
to position your lines start/stop

332
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:18,095
and so and %uh some the simplest the

333
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:21,113
example I could covers that

334
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:26,085
a forces also have their own are links
also have their own parameters

335
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:29,089
I'd like to talk about just link
distance and a

336
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:34,029
as you might guess like distance just
specifies

337
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:37,121
the early distance the link the the link
to the links

338
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:41,021
um a based on

339
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:44,046
some value so another insight

340
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:47,079
is you can make that link distance

341
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,088
driven by data sorry instead have been a
constant

342
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,840
it can it can be a

343
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:56,086
it can represent some data value and
this

344
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:59,175
in this case the link a data has some
value

345
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:04,087
distance that you could use to to expand
occurred tracked each like

346
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:07,165
at upper legs level and that's
essentially all I've done in this

347
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:09,073
particular

348
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:12,073
visualization where I was looking that
um

349
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:16,642
a communities in neighborhoods that have
a sharp racial divide

350
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:20,450
so here this is Kansas City and each

351
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,774
each node is now represented by census
tract

352
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,380
and like I said today you don't you're
not constrained by

353
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,065
bubbles on sand underneath it and so
each census tract is connected to its

354
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:32,148
neighbors

355
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:37,067
by links an invisible links and that
this isn't hasn't started yet

356
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:41,090
but the link for those links is relative
to the proportion

357
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,048
up a white and black populations between

358
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,040
that mean that neighbor and its neighbor
you know that that

359
00:21:48,004 --> 00:21:51,413
census tract as neighbor so iron

360
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,140
if there's a sharp a jump and

361
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,049
in white or black population so if you
go from one

362
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,110
census tract is 20 percent white to its
neighbor be in 20 percent

363
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:06,087
black then then that link will be longer

364
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:09,185
so we start this it it starts to break
apart

365
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:13,119
at areas where there's this real high
division

366
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:17,067
and I just I read I is sorry that

367
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,098
you understand kinda a

368
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:23,146
the medium emotionally intense a value

369
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:28,079
I want to just kinda look at a way to
represent how these

370
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,218
um a racial boundaries affected the

371
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:35,820
the first that the spatial a very small
areas in which they occur

372
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:38,115
so are there's that's a bit that's all
but up

373
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:44,021
underline that we're just a link
distances you know i trick on their

374
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:48,141
so we can start expanding these concepts

375
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,095
a and the first the first and I thought
have when

376
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:55,152
um I'll kinda discovered the multiple
centers

377
00:22:56,052 --> 00:23:00,127
idea as what have you put it into a
circle you know her like circles

378
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:04,036
so here's my interactive hair ball that
I did

379
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:07,057
for a I my the

380
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:10,096
the people that I work with artwork for
as towers they

381
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:14,139
wanna just got over IRT representation
of collaboration you know what are the

382
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,043
main

383
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:18,161
science stances everybody climbers with
one another sorry to these

384
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:23,095
these are these groups is a lab each
node you circle it is a

385
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:26,095
individual in that lab and there's links
between them

386
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:29,099
based on how many papers are on together
on

387
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,049
so it's fun and it allows for
exploration again

388
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:36,054
all I'm defining they are the a route
the cert

389
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:40,098
the center's along a circle right on for
each slab

390
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:43,667
%uh not to individuals which means we
can do stuff like

391
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:49,790
reordering the um the circle center
locations for makes everything move

392
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:49,838
around you know

393
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:53,640
kinda fun you can you can change and if
you change the

394
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:57,091
a the to a radius that your

395
00:23:57,091 --> 00:24:01,095
applying the circle to you can make
pretty but useless you know obviously

396
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:04,191
artistic a spiral love spiro love
collaboration

397
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:09,230
s but you get to find out who's who's
the coolest kid in there

398
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,950
India the group there on

399
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:18,149
if if you want you know %uh a little bit
a mass in turn affect how I feel

400
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:22,056
embarrassed for need in this country
Myers after their previous stock but

401
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:27,045
da Mac right has a great introduction to
this a math for pictures which i think

402
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:27,090
is a

403
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,017
is a wonderful Explorer introduction to
using

404
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:34,787
up using this kind of math to generate
circles and stuff

405
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:40,130
another example up from a website called
Let's free congress

406
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:43,058
that was used is kinda vague extension a

407
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:46,397
above the idea that are they're looking
at

408
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,600
the small number of people that
contributed large amounts of money

409
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:53,012
to a to election funding

410
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:57,981
um but these the visual was kind of
interesting I thought I have recreated

411
00:24:58,179 --> 00:24:59,200
so

412
00:24:59,002 --> 00:25:02,071
you start out with a bunch of nodes I
kinda wanted

413
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:06,127
Kill Bill new music to be playing at
this that's why the color scheme is such

414
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:10,075
um and as the sender node expands

415
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,136
the to the the nodes around it are kinda
repulsed

416
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:17,036
a kinda in a very organic matter right

417
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:21,040
I i like it and then when you come back
down and they are

418
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:24,033
jump on I'm but this is

419
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:27,100
is trivial now that we know um

420
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,047
the previous examples there's all
building on so we can tell

421
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:35,119
this is a the collision detection is
isn't in effect here

422
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:39,044
um but it's also just a modification

423
00:25:39,044 --> 00:25:42,059
love the um the charge

424
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,132
right up for that center know it so you
get get a value from your slider

425
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:50,059
and then modify your charge function to
utilize that

426
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:54,088
value and on that's all you need to do
to create this kind have

427
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:59,094
interesting visual where it was again
not much work

428
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:02,129
the last I like to look into and death
is a

429
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:07,070
is a ok I have a deviation for Moretz
sterner stuff on earth

430
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:12,010
um it's called he's got a again have a
buzzer cut bread experiments

431
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,098
and the idea is um you start out with a
grade he represented by these

432
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:20,667
these dots are kinda hard to see um by
the only

433
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:26,530
apply force layout diagram and this case
is this random data but

434
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:30,091
the they have to offer they have to
follow two rules one

435
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:33,098
they need to stay on on a grid spot

436
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:38,126
and two um no two nodes can stay on the
same grid spot

437
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:42,026
so when you started up I

438
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:46,095
grades is kinda very interesting looking
on patterns them

439
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:49,324
and a you can modify the

440
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:54,480
the are the shape up your grid
underlined fears

441
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:57,089
here's more just rectangle bird and you
can see the

442
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,116
they kinda move those you ask you know

443
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:04,063
there's little tweaking that goes on as
it as it sits there

444
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:07,104
and the reason behind that is %uh
there's actually two nodes

445
00:27:08,004 --> 00:27:12,070
associated with each other up with these
are these points the the

446
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:15,089
from the visual 1 and then this
underline one that still getting

447
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:19,114
manipulated by the other forces in
effect so you have these two

448
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:23,016
parameters a are these two roles and
then

449
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,111
and then there's still the charge and
constraints are being applied

450
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:30,014
to up to these notes

451
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:34,021
so %uh I was the first a nice thought
when I saw this was

452
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:37,107
so it's you know subway maps and trans
amass a I kind of wanted a

453
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:41,023
create that for density so here's

454
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:44,032
attend city subways works pretty good
right

455
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:48,101
I a we don't have we don't have

456
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:53,014
I was further inspired tour and by that
I mean

457
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:56,020
easy access to data I'll when fathom did
this

458
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,077
this is very similar experiment with the
the Boston

459
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:03,098
a subway systems here so fat and has a
great post about

460
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,104
how much geography can we get rid of and
in transit maps in self

461
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:10,907
you know it's a there's a just a thought
process but I really liked

462
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:14,580
the visual display here so I thought I'd
retry it

463
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:17,267
with the with this simple

464
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:21,130
more you know a simpler than it really
define the algorithm that they they use

465
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:21,922
to it

466
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:25,390
to create that visual but now we know
the

467
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,698
the algorithm here so we'll start start
each node which is this

468
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:33,100
a subway station will start them at
their geographic

469
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,480
you know physical location and then
we'll let the simulation run

470
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,113
and see what happens and its interesting

471
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:45,027
%uh I think it's kind of artistic and
and fun I don't know about the

472
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:45,110
practically

473
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:49,014
you know being able to read this item
I'm not from Boston soda

474
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:53,592
doesn't matter to me but yeah

475
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,880
but it is a event is Elise the starting
point is something to

476
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:59,164
to conjure up more ideas and I look
forward to seeing some others

477
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:03,102
um I've got three more

478
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:08,771
quick examples above up these same
prince was being applied and and

479
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:12,864
in the real world %uh the first one is a
notre site but is Barack Obama the

480
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:15,730
president dot com from the

481
00:29:15,073 --> 00:29:18,108
the Guardian right at these bow the the

482
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:23,103
balloons themselves are a are being
controlled by force last so they have a

483
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:27,008
up you know buoyancy kinda concept that
are making the flow

484
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:30,059
and then if you were to hover over one
up on you get the same

485
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,136
radius expanding concept to to a lesser
degree that kinda pushes

486
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:39,105
and focuses in on one %uh once the one
balloon

487
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:43,690
I also have I like this one this the
save my library by

488
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:46,086
us Sarah Groff plum borough UX the

489
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:49,110
designer I privates for her name and San
Francisco

490
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:53,710
I I those edges and as a says she's
gonna find

491
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:57,950
or are making no dove her library her
books actually contains

492
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,173
as is the simple concert again we're
just using

493
00:30:01,073 --> 00:30:05,402
the same idea as multiple Center points
but now with a lot more from

494
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:10,690
but allows for starting to quantify
these different categories and

495
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:13,121
in an intuitive way you know the larger
bubble group is

496
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:18,059
means a larger number books there and
this again is part of a larger

497
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,132
interaction that can be moved around him
and modified

498
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:25,251
come and explore and finally a

499
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:30,840
discusses a recent a kinda dash for they
called gravity

500
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:33,160
where and you to these you to these a.m.

501
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:37,715
quite nodes represents a a topic

502
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:41,408
and a the and the bubbles that start
forming around it

503
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,010
are a %uh comments and conversations
around those topics

504
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:49,013
and the the more the same part is that
this is real time in it and it gets

505
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,097
updated while you watch it but

506
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:54,114
but it's the same affect really the
notes themselves are part of a force

507
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:55,088
layout

508
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:58,089
and each had the and nodes in a
particular

509
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:01,126
a category are being drawn organically

510
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,041
to to the center which happens to be
there

511
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:08,076
the right topic no and so

512
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:12,355
you know whether a little bit of a work
they're allowed they're allowed to have

513
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,076
all this flexibility

514
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:18,580
from buyer just to find these the civil
rule sets

515
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:21,062
so hopefully we've seen a little bit
behind the magic

516
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:25,119
above the force right this is Frank us
you know controlling your right and I'm

517
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:30,051
school and a um

518
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:33,590
that was you know I mean point is to
take away some of the magic behind this

519
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:39,060
I think it's important that on we get to
see the the how of

520
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,020
of summer these you know visualizations
that were inspired by

521
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:47,050
and and try to the breaking down to
little components that we can then

522
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,062
abuse ourselves so look for your abuses

523
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:58,007
and I'm thanks

524
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:10,669
into question oh yes questions

525
00:32:33,003 --> 00:32:36,010
been

526
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:40,700
yeah

527
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,380
right yeah now I think I think
somebody's arced

528
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,057
again starting points a I love where

529
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,700
the yeah that you concerning coding

530
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:56,009
iron more you can start applying more
simple rules

531
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:59,171
to these it to to make them more finesse
um

532
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:05,088
but I i've seen examples I've way I use
on my ex-wife beam

533
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:12,088
being part of the it yeah

534
00:33:13,014 --> 00:33:17,051
and and so is i mean there's yeah so
were seen examples where

535
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:21,052
well in the Obama the the first one here
are

536
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:24,321
one-third and talk about something that
also makes it

537
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:29,210
to a to think get to it something that
makes it cool as

538
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:33,062
a that there are you there actually
doubling code in there

539
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:37,069
on the color %uh the

540
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:41,036
when we get to it there

541
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:44,062
I am color shows the amount

542
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:48,151
I love cut increase right says but that
is kinda also double encoded by

543
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:53,460
it that the layer that it's in so I i
really like

544
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,610
that their they're adding that nuance I
don't talk about but so

545
00:33:57,061 --> 00:34:00,083
in this I guess though the Y is you know

546
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,922
at least a hoping that that

547
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:08,230
that separation by keeping vans layered

548
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:11,412
and the implementation others you just
add another

549
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:14,716
I'll custom force and and I could allow
for time but

550
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:19,060
the nuances that they have they have the

551
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:23,028
they've multiplied by alpha twice for
that particular for so

552
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:26,097
the affect the impact love

553
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:30,040
above the tearing is lest then the
impact of the

554
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:34,563
separation so you you end up you can
blame them to your own discretion how

555
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,210
much you want the

556
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:39,210
wonder affect you know the other if you
are both sick or whatever

557
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,494
I thought that was a nice may have made
may be an example where this is

558
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:50,349
the starting to occur

559
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,652
or

560
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:03,030
were hmm where

561
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:08,062
or court yes

562
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:11,076
yeah I V cool from and im in my

563
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,094
my hair ball are those links art

564
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:17,143
impacting the the locations of the nodes

565
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:21,104
but but yeah i certainly a and an easy

566
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:25,070
optimization to that would sit to be
able to make him the order of those

567
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:26,014
knows more meaningful and thats

568
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:31,007
the reordering was was an attempt at
that but utilizing

569
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:34,012
the data the the date inherent in that

570
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:37,079
and that is that would be much more
powerful where to to

571
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:44,057
a start looking at the process

572
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:48,155
or a

573
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:53,110
well i think thats depend on the
technology like we've seen

574
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:57,023
um this same can bog down after

575
00:35:57,032 --> 00:36:02,068
in SVG after a couple hundred nodes and
it did send certainly seems I'm not an

576
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:05,095
expert but seems to be depended on the
browser you're looking at 2i mean

577
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:08,141
I I'm doing this in Chrome for a reason

578
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,054
now most it is one flies well and at
least

579
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:15,093
earlier iterations a Firefox and so the
other browsers

580
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:20,160
um I know there've been experiments and
using cameras and I think that the

581
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:22,035
performance can be in

582
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:25,095
improved after you get a certain head to
a certain threshold um

583
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:29,116
but I might be incorrect about that %uh
the stock has a

584
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:33,047
air example if comparing SPG and

585
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:36,060
and canvas imitations not the force
layout but a bunch of

586
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:39,040
notes moving around in there a here's

587
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:42,189
I they they do work in a similar spot
efficiency at

588
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:46,096
at certain numbers but that certain
numbers for

589
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:50,141
after

590
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:54,053
you her
